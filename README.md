# Unified Forth (u4th)

The aim of this Forth is running Standard Forth code inside all programming languages' projects.

Aim in points:
* Pass all Standard Forth tests
* Each implementation execute functions from the parent language
* All of Standard Forth packages be written in Forth itself except the absolute necessary words in `core`
* each language have a folder with two folders inside.
    * normal: where the code is easiest to read
    * fast: where the code is fastest
